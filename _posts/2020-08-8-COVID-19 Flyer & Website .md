**COVID-19 Safety Campaign and Real-Time Information Website for Isla Vista**

*Project Overview:*
In response to the rising COVID-19 cases in Isla Vista, I initiated a community-driven campaign aimed at raising awareness and encouraging both residents and visitors to adopt safety measures. The primary objective was to emphasize our collective responsibility in curbing the spread of the virus.

**Key Achievements:**

*Targeted Awareness Flyers:* Designed and distributed two distinct flyers targeting different audiences, each featuring a QR code linked to a dedicated non-commercial website. These materials served as visual reminders of the importance of adhering to safety precautions.

*Interactive Information Hub:* Developed a website (http://covid19islavista.com) using self-taught HTML, CSS, and design skills. The website served as an information hub, providing essential guidance on COVID-19 safety practices.

*Real-Time Data Dashboard:* Introduced a live dashboard on the website, offering up-to-date statistics on active cases in Isla Vista, confirmed cases within the community, and total cases in Santa Barbara County. This feature empowered residents with timely information.

*Impressive User Engagement:* Garnered over 1,025 users on the website within the first three weeks of launch, with an average of 53 daily users during that period. This demonstrated the community's interest in staying informed.

*Media Recognition:* Shared the project's motivation and impact through an interview with KCSB radio station and earned a feature on the KCSB COVID-19 website. These opportunities amplified the reach of the campaign.

This project reflects my dedication to community well-being, proactive learning, and effective communication. By combining design skills with data-driven information dissemination, we collectively made a meaningful contribution to mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in Isla Vista.
